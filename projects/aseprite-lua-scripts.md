for Aseprite v1.2.10-beta2+

# Overview
custom lua scripts for the pixelart editor Aseprite

The following scripts are currently included in this package:
* TwitterSafe
  * prevents Twitter from using jpg-compression on Pixelart
* RandomColors
  * simply loops through the sprite and sets every pixel to a different color (RGB or Grayscale)
  * Useful for random color paletts or texture overlays

More will be added sooner or later. <3
