# Overview
My game submission for GitHubGameOff2017 Game Jam on the theme THROWBACK.

First Game, first Game Jam.

Dark PonBul is a "simple" really short game, inspired by DARK Souls, PONg & BULlet-Hell.

!!Attention!! this game is heavily RNG based.

Avoid getting hit from enemy bullets and THROW BACK a special bullet to damage the enemy.
